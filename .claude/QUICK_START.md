# Claude Agent System - Quick Start (10/10 Code Quality)

## Primary Command

Just use: `/systemcc "describe what you want to do"`

The enhanced system automatically:
1. **3-Dimensional Analysis** - Evaluates complexity, risk, and scope for optimal workflow selection
2. **Build Configuration Detection** - Automatically detects and applies Makefile, CI/CD, and linting rules
3. **Intelligent Routing** - Selects optimal workflow based on decision algorithms
4. **Quality Assurance** - Validates all inputs, handles errors gracefully, and maintains production standards
5. **Performance Optimization** - Uses early termination, caching, and efficient pattern matching
6. **Transparent Reasoning** - Provides detailed decision explanations and alternative suggestions

## Examples

```bash
# Simple fix (auto-detects low complexity/risk)
/systemcc "fix typo in login page"

# Complex feature (auto-detects high complexity, triggers comprehensive validation)
/systemcc "implement user authentication with OAuth"

# Large refactoring (auto-detects high context load, uses phase-based execution)
/systemcc "refactor all API endpoints to use new pattern"

# Critical task (auto-detects risk factors, uses enhanced validation)
/systemcc "urgent: fix production database connection issue"
```

## Intelligent Features

### Decision Engine Transparency
- Real-time scoring across 3 dimensions (Complexity/Risk/Scope)
- Build configuration auto-detection and application
- Confidence levels and alternative workflow suggestions
- Performance metrics and optimization feedback
- Detailed reasoning for all workflow selections

### Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Robust error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Performance-optimized execution with early termination
- Production-ready robustness and reliability

## Auto-Adaptation

- `/analyzecc` - Deep project analysis with quality standards
  - Auto-detects tech stack with enhanced pattern recognition
  - Configures quality checks and validation rules
  - Updates all commands with optimized parameters

## Manual Commands (Power Users)

- `/topus` v3.0 - Dual-mode: PLAN (analysis/exploration) or EXECUTE (implementation pipeline)
  - Auto-detects mode from intent, or use `--plan` / `--exec` flags
  - Example: `/topus "analyze auth system"` (PLAN) | `/topus "add OAuth2"` (EXECUTE)
  - Features: DSVP, CIA, CPE, confidence scoring, wave-based execution
- `/orchestrated` - Force streamlined workflow with error handling
- `/planner` - Start complete system with comprehensive validation
- `/help` - Show enhanced command system

## Advanced Context Management

The system uses intelligent context load prediction:
- Monitors token usage and file complexity in real-time
- Predicts context growth using statistical models
- Automatically switches to phase-based execution when needed
- Maintains optimal performance through smart resource management

## File Organization

Temporary workflow files are stored in `~/.claude/temp/` during execution:
- `~/.claude/temp/wireframes/` - ASCII wireframes (Anti-YOLO workflow)
- `~/.claude/temp/analysis/` - Project analysis files
- `~/.claude/temp/standards/` - Standards framework files
- `~/.claude/temp/WORK.md` - Current workflow state

**IMPORTANT**: Documentation files are NOT auto-created in your project. They are only created when you explicitly request them.

See `CLAUDE.md` for complete guidelines.

Happy coding! 🚀
