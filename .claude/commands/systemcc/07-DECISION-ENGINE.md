# DECISION ENGINE MODULE

Two-phase workflow selection: Domain Detection first, then Complexity Scoring fallback.

## Two-Phase Decision System

**Critical**: This engine uses ALL 6 available workflows, not just 3.

### Available Workflows

| Workflow | Purpose | Best For |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `anti-yolo-web` | Web app development specialist | Frontend, React, Vue, dashboards, UI components |
| `aidevtasks` | PRD-based feature development | New features requiring product specs |
| `agetos` | Project initialization/standards | Setup, conventions, new projects |
| `topus` (v3.0) | Dual-mode orchestration: PLAN (analysis) / EXECUTE (implementation) | Architecture analysis, migrations, complex unknowns, deep planning, large-scale implementations |
| `complete_system` | Full 6-agent validation pipeline | Moderate features, refactoring with validation |
| `orchestrated` | Streamlined 3-agent workflow | Simple fixes, config changes, quick tasks |

---

## Phase 1: Domain Detection (CHECK FIRST)

Before any scoring, Claude semantically analyzes if the task matches a specialized domain.

### Domain Detection Matrix

| Domain | Workflow | Detection Signals (Semantic, Not Keywords) |
|--------|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Web Development** | `anti-yolo-web` | Building/modifying web interfaces, React/Vue/Angular components, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, dashboards, forms, buttons, frontend UI, responsive design, web apps |
| **Feature Development** | `aidevtasks` | "build feature", "create system", product requirements needed, user stories, new functionality with multiple components, detailed specs beneficial |
| **Project Setup** | `agetos` | Initialize project, setup standards, establish conventions, new project structure, team coding standards, project configuration |
| **Deep Planning / Analysis** | `topus --plan` | Architecture design, "plan first" requests, exploration, audit, assess, investigate, evaluate, review, study, "how should we", "what's the best approach", significant unknowns |
| **Complex Implementation** | `topus --exec` | Major refactoring, system migration, large-scale builds, multi-component implementation, deploy, remove, replace, upgrade system-wide changes |

### Phase 1 Decision Logic

```
IF task clearly matches a specialized domain with HIGH confidence:
   → Use that specialized workflow directly
   → Skip Phase 2

IF no domain matches OR confidence is LOW:
   → Proceed to Phase 2 (Complexity Scoring)
```

---

## Phase 2: Complexity Scoring (FALLBACK)

Only when NO specialized domain is detected, use 3-dimensional assessment.

### The Three Dimensions

| Dimension | What to Assess | Scale |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| **Complexity** | How intricate is the implementation? | 1 (trivial) to 5 (very complex) |
| **Risk** | What could go wrong? Data loss? Breaking changes? | 1 (safe) to 5 (high stakes) |
| **Scope** | How much of the codebase is affected? | 1 (single file) to 5 (system-wide) |

### Complexity-Based Workflow Selection

| Combined Score | Workflow | Use Case |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| 1.0 - 2.0 | `orchestrated` | Bug fixes, small changes, config updates, typos |
| 2.1 - 3.5 | `complete_system` | Moderate features, refactoring, validation needed |
| 3.6 - 5.0 | `topus` (v3.0 auto-detects PLAN/EXECUTE mode) | Complex multi-system changes, high risk |

## Display Format

Always show the decision transparently with phase indication:

### Phase 1 Match (Domain Detected)

```
🧠 DECISION ENGINE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Task: "create a React dashboard with charts"

Phase 1 - Domain Detection:
✓ Web Development detected
  → React components, dashboard UI, frontend work

→ Using **anti-yolo-web** workflow
```

### Phase 2 Fallback (No Domain Match)

```
🧠 DECISION ENGINE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Task: "fix the login button color"

Phase 1 - Domain Detection:
✗ No specialized domain detected (simple CSS fix)

Phase 2 - Complexity Assessment:
• Complexity: 1/5 - Single CSS property change
• Risk: 1/5 - UI only, no logic affected
• Scope: 1/5 - One file

Combined: 1.0 → Using **orchestrated** workflow
```

  → analyze, assess, "how should we" — PLAN mode signal words

→ Using **topus --plan** workflow (v3.0 PLAN mode: analysis only, no code changes)
  Features: CIA risk scoring, CPE pattern extraction, confidence scoring, 3-level planning
```

### Example 4b: Complex Implementation → topus EXECUTE mode
```
Task: "migrate the entire REST API to GraphQL across all services"

Phase 1 - Domain Detection:
✓ Complex Implementation detected
  → migrate, entire, system-wide — EXECUTE mode signal words

→ Using **topus --exec** workflow (v3.0 EXECUTE mode: full implementation pipeline)
  Features: wave-based execution, DSVP validation, signal bus, adaptive timeouts
```

### Example 5: No Domain → Complexity Fallback
```
Task: "fix typo in readme"

Phase 1 - Domain Detection:
✗ No specialized domain detected

Phase 2 - Complexity Assessment:
• Complexity: 1/5 - Single character change
• Risk: 1/5 - Documentation only
• Scope: 1/5 - One file

Combined: 1.0 → Using **orchestrated** workflow
```

### Example 6: No Domain → Moderate Complexity
```
Task: "add pagination to the user list API"

Phase 1 - Domain Detection:
✗ No specialized domain (general backend work)

Phase 2 - Complexity Assessment:
• Complexity: 2/5 - Standard pagination pattern
• Risk: 2/5 - Could affect API consumers

Combined: 2.0 → Using **orchestrated** workflow
```

### Example 7: No Domain → Higher Complexity
```
Task: "refactor the payment processing module"

Phase 1 - Domain Detection:
✗ No specialized domain (internal refactor)

Phase 2 - Complexity Assessment:
• Complexity: 3/5 - Multiple interconnected functions
• Risk: 4/5 - Payment is business-critical
• Scope: 3/5 - Payment module + integrations

Combined: 3.3 → Using **complete_system** workflow
```

## Why Two-Phase Over Single Scoring

**Old approach (score-only)**:
- All tasks scored 1-5 on complexity/risk/scope
- Only 3 workflows available based on score
- **Problem**: Specialized workflows like `anti-yolo-web` were never selected

**New approach (domain-first)**:
- Phase 1 detects if task matches a specialized domain
- Specialized workflows get used when appropriate
- Phase 2 handles general tasks that don't fit domains
- **Benefit**: Full utilization of all 6 powerful workflows

## Semantic Analysis (Not Keyword Matching)

**Critical**: Both phases use genuine semantic understanding, not keyword detection.

Claude understands:
- "fix security vulnerability" is high-risk (not just "fix")
- "refactor CSS" is low-risk (not just "refactor")
- "create dashboard" is web development (semantic domain match)
- "build feature" may need PRD flow (semantic intent detection)

## Integration

This module integrates with:
- `02-LYRA-OPTIMIZATION.md` - Task understanding before decision
- `04-WORKFLOW-SELECTION.md` - Available workflow definitions
- `05-IMPLEMENTATION-STEPS.md` - Execution after selection

## Confidence Reporting

After assessment, Claude reports confidence:

| Confidence | Meaning | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| **High** (0.9+) | Clear domain match or obvious scoring | Proceed immediately |
| **Medium** (0.7-0.9) | Reasonable selection with some ambiguity | Proceed with note |
| **Low** (<0.7) | Task unclear, multiple workflows possible | Ask clarifying questions |

## Topus v3.0 Dual-Mode Routing

Topus v3.0 introduces **dual-mode operation**. The decision engine must detect the correct mode:

### PLAN Mode (analysis only, no code changes)

**Indicators**:
- Analysis verbs: analyze, investigate, explore, map, audit, assess, evaluate, review, study, understand, explain, document, compare, research
- Strategy markers: "how should we", "what's the best approach", "propose a strategy"
- Question markers: "how does X work", "what would happen if", exploratory phrasing

**Override flag**: `--plan`

**Output**: Architecture analysis, risk assessments, confidence-scored findings, 3-level plans (strategic/tactical/operational)

### EXECUTE Mode (full implementation pipeline)

**Indicators**:
- Imperative verbs: add, implement, create, build, fix, refactor, migrate, deploy, remove, delete, replace, upgrade, update, change, modify
- Outcome markers: specific deliverables, file changes, concrete outputs expected

**Override flag**: `--exec`

**Output**: Wave-based code execution, DSVP-validated changes, test strategy with coverage targets

### Auto-Detection

When no flag is provided, Topus v3.0 analyzes signal words in the user's prompt to auto-detect the mode. The decision engine should pass mode hints when the intent is clear.

### v3.0 Features Reference

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **DSVP** | Domain-Specific Verification Profiles (auth, database, API, frontend, infra) |
| **Signal Bus** | Inter-agent communication during implementation |
| **CIA** | Change Impact Analysis with risk scoring (1-10) |
| **CPE** | Codebase Pattern Extraction (learns project conventions) |
| **Confidence Scoring** | HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW on all exploration findings |
| **Wave Execution** | Dependency-ordered agent deployment |
| **3-Level Planning** | Level 1 (strategic), Level 2 (tactical), Level 3 (operational) |
| **Test Strategy** | Automated test planning with coverage targets |
| **Adaptive Timeouts** | Tier-based timeout management |
