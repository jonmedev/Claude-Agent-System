## Example 7a: Topus v3.0 PLAN Mode (Analysis/Exploration)

```
User: /systemcc "analyze how our authentication system works"

Claude: 🎯 SYSTEMCC DETECTED - Command acknowledged and workflow initiated
✅ Following SYSTEMCC workflow instructions from CLAUDE.md

[Lyra optimization...]

🧠 Workflow Detection:
- Analysis/exploration intent detected
→ Routing to Topus v3.0 (PLAN mode - no code changes)

🔍 Mode: PLAN (auto-detected from "analyze" intent)
   Override: use --exec flag to force EXECUTE mode

🔄 Parallel Exploration: Spawning analysis agents...
├─ Agent 1: Auth architecture mapping
├─ Agent 2: Dependency analysis
├─ Agent 3: Security pattern review
└─ Agent 4: Integration points

📊 Findings (Confidence Scored):
- [HIGH] JWT-based auth with refresh tokens in auth/middleware.js
- [HIGH] Role-based access control in models/user.js
- [MEDIUM] Session fallback for legacy endpoints
- [LOW] Potential circular dependency in auth/providers/

📋 CIA (Change Impact Analysis):
- 12 files depend on auth middleware
- Risk: HIGH if middleware signature changes

✨ Analysis complete! Report saved to ~/.claude/plans/
No code was modified (PLAN mode).

## Common Patterns

### Always Show:
1. Detection feedback FIRST
2. Lyra optimization box
3. Workflow selection reasoning
4. Batch optimization analysis (when beneficial)
5. Phase progress updates
6. Completion message

### Never Show:
- "Run /planner next"
- "Execute /verifier to continue"
- "Use /agetos for this"
- Any command suggestions

### User Interactions:
- Only for clarifications
- Only for specifications
- Only for decisions
- Never for workflow control
